# odin-facebook

This project is part of the Odin Project online course, find it at 
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project

In this project, my attention will only be on the backend with focus on
data base and association, as most of my rails project has been, this project tries to mimic some of facebooks behaviours,
which includes, a signed in user could create a post, a post could be liked, it could also be commented by any other user as well, a user could send and recieve friend requests etc.

I have found the project really interesting and the rails course and projects in general has
build my confidence and knowledge and i have also improved in time management(working and taking the odin project course).

i am very confident i can build apps of this kind or another using the knowledge i have 
gained from the Odin Project ruby on rails course.
